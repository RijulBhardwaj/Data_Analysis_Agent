            If the query requires creating a bar chart, reply as follows:
            {"bar": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

            If the query requires creating a line chart, reply as follows:
            {"line": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

            There can only be two types of chart, "bar" and "line".

            {"answer": "The title with the highest rating is 'Gilead'"}

            {"answer": "I do not know."}

            All strings in "columns" list and data list, should be in double quotes,
